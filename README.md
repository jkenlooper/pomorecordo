## PomoRecordo.sh

Record screen and audio for 25 min pomodoro and display-messages to
tmux.

**Includes bonus opening-title creation.**

Example video that I made (no audio):

<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGxVocBEi30" title="YouTube video
player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Why?

This script started off as a few lines and then got more complex.
I wouldn't say it's pretty or has much use beyond my own, but maybe it
could potentially be useful to someone else.

## Usage

_Read through the [pomorecordo.sh](pomorecordo.sh) shell script._ And then make
up your mind if you still want to use this.

It is crazy user friendly and can misuse common misconceptions about errors
well. Or, maybe it is more successful then it was with that last temporary fix,
but now it's a Tuesday.  Anyways, there is always room for more errors to keep
things interesting.

## Just use OBS

Like I have stated earlier...this was originally a simple script that got messy
quick as I was only focused on solving my own problem.  It is certainly not
designed for everyone.  There are other ways of recording your screen and
creating time-lapse videos. One could even throw together a simple shell script
that wraps around a few `ffmpeg` commands to accomplish that.  If you do that,
I'd suggest coming up with some cool name for your shell script.  Naming shell
scripts is a good creative use of your time!

On the other hand; there exists a much more feature rich tool called
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

I suggest using that and not this. Have a nice day! :)
